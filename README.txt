Laurence Malong Portfolio

[Laurence Malonga](http://laurencemabilleau.com/) it a personal project for updating new and existing skils, that I have learnt during the past and current years. It a website for all my work portfolio.
The website has Four pages: 
Page One: A Landing Page with a brief description of  what I can do, list of the latest projects, the process taken for each work the project, a section about me and contact form.
Page Two: Work Portfolio Page, wich will contain all my project that I have build.
Page Three: A Resume Page: This page contain all the information about my latest update Resume.
Page Four: Resource page will consit of all the learing material and tools that I use.

I have use a Three Pillars to write a good project:

1: It a Responsive Design: Fluid Grid and Layouts (float layout, flexbox layout, and CSS Grid layout), Flexible Responsive Image, (Resolution, Density Switching, and Art Direciton)
and Media Queries for mobil or desktop first. And I use a Graceful Degradtion for browser support with @supports

2: It Maintainable Web and scalable: The think - build - architect mindset. 
  
Thinking of the layout: 
    Component -Driven-Design: 
        Modular building blocks that make up interfaces;
        Held together by the layout of the page;
        Re-usable across a project, and between different projects; 
        Independent, allowing us to use them anywhere on the page.

Build The Layout: BEM (Block Element Modifier) Methodology 

    BLOCK: standalone component that is meaningful on its own. 
    ELEMENT: part of a block that has no standalone meaning. 
    MODIFIER: a different version of a block or an element.

Architect Mindset: use of the 7-1 Pattern:

7 different folders for partial Sass files, and 1 main Sass file to import all other files into a compiled CSS stylesheet.

    The 7 folders are:
    base/ components/ layout/ pages/ themes/ abstracts/ vendors/

I use Nodejs and NPM for my local server web development, and for tools, libraries and frameworks

 
3: It A performance code: Use of SASS css Processor to build a  Simple Build Process
    The Build Process:
    Compilation, Concatenation, Prefixing and Compressing.
